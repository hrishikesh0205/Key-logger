A keylogger is a type of program that records the keys you press on your keyboard. It's like having a hidden camera for your computer keyboard. People use keyloggers for various reasons - sometimes for legitimate purposes like keeping track of what's typed for parental control or troubleshooting, but unfortunately, they can also be used maliciously to steal sensitive information.

In the basic keylogger you've created, it does two main things:

1. **Recording Keystrokes**: When you run the keylogger program, it starts quietly listening to your keyboard. Whenever you press a key, it records which key you pressed. If you hit the "Enter" key, it records that as a new line. It also pays attention to special keys like "Backspace" and "Tab". It collects all this information and saves it into a file called "keylogger.txt".

2. **Sending Keystrokes via Email**: After recording some keystrokes, the keylogger takes the contents of the "keylogger.txt" file, which now holds the keystrokes you've typed, and sends it as an email to a specified email address. This email is sent through an email service using your provided email and password.
